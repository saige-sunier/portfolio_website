                        <p className="intro-text">When Covid-19 hit the United States in March 2020, the country faced extreme personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages. Design that Matters responded by rapidly designing and fabricating face shields for local hospitals. <b>By partnering with local Seattle-based volunteers, Harborview Medical, and Global Tech Plastics we were able to produce over 300,000 injection molded face shields</b> to be delivered to WA hospitals.</p>
                        <p className="intro-text">In the Fall of 2020 we started hearing of additional PPE shortages due to the fall surge. This led to a reboot of packaging and we sent a few hundred more face shields to Harborview Medical and Gallup Indian Health Service (IHS) hospital (NM). We started to wonder if other IHS hospitals were experiencing the same PPE shortages and, if so, if the demand was high enough to coordinate another production run of GTP face shields.</p>
                        <p className="intro-text"><b>I successfully identified 15 hospitals experiencing PPE shortages,</b> the majority were IHS hospitals in rural areas who often operate outside of standard supply chains. I established distribution connections to deliver the face shields directly to each hospital's supply center. <b>In total, we packaged and delivered over 1,000 faceshields to these small rural hospitals.</b> </p>

                                    <p>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) released digital headforms that represent the 5 most common face shapes and sizes: small, medium, large, short/wide, and long/narrow. These digital headforms were released on the NIOSH website. </p>
                                    <p>I downloaded the digital headforms and decided to make adjustments before fabricating them. I wanted to demonstrate the range of head circumferences the face shields are designed to fit so I scaled the heads uniformly to give us a 5% female, a 50% female, a 50% male, and a 95% male. These 5 biometrics provide a good range to demonstrate the productâ€™s capabilities.</p>

I used Fusion360 Slicer to generate dxf files for laser cutting and assembled a full head using cardboard. After some tinkering I 3D printed the heads. The heads are too large to fit on one printer bed so I used Luban to split the design into 3 components that could be fitted together after printing.</p>
